To whom it might concern

The version of Eclipse that I was using is newer than the one used across the university. If there are any problems with importing my code, please follow these steps:

1) create a new java project in eclipse

2) add contents from the src folder to the src folder in the newly-created project

3) add Jars from the "Required JARs" catalogue to the newly-created project

4) run "Core" class to start the program
